## Pull Request Process
0. Follow [PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/). The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).
1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed by the end of the development.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables and useful file locations.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
4. Create feature branches. Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
5. One pull request per feature. If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
6. Send coherent history. Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.
7. Be patient, issues and pull-requests are reviewed in free time.

#### Happy Coding!
